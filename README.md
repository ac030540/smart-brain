Smart brain is an app which detects the celebrity present in the image whose URL you submit.


The URL must not begin with https:google.com/url as this URL is the url for the image embedded in an article and hence, the image isn't detected accurately.

For example, https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjv6s77i_vkAhVuILcAHTWQDYYQjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fm.economictimes.com%2Fnews%2Feconomy%2Fforeign-trade%2Findia-china-no-longer-developing-nations-wont-let-them-take-advantage-from-wto-donald-trump%2Farticleshow%2F70673014.cms&psig=AOvVaw3H9Isal4KJsHQ-yoYPe1r3&ust=1570020358280951 can't be given as an input.
